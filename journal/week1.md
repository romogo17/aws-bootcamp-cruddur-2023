### Containerize Applications
- Created the `Dockerfile` for both the frontend and backend apps
- Created the `docker-compose.yml` file

#### BACKEND
```sh
# build
docker build -t  backend-flask ./backend-flask

# run
docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -d -e FRONTEND_URL='*' -e BACKEND_URL='*' backend-flask
```

#### FRONTEND
```sh
# build
docker build -t frontend-react-js ./frontend-react-js

# run
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 -d frontend-react-js
```

#### DOCKER COMPOSE

In our `docker-compose.yml` file, we're mounting directories with the local contents of the repos (`volumes`). If we don't have the required dependencies installed, our app won't run properly
```
cd backend-flask
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

cd frontend-react-js
npm install
```
Then,

```sh
docker compose up
```

### OpenAPI Documentation for notifications endpoint
Completed the documentation of the notifications endpoint following the OpenAPI specification.

I'm glad we're using this! I had ussed swagger back then but hadn't played around with it in some time ðŸ˜„

### Flask backend endpoint for notifications

Created the Flask backend endpoint for notifications

### React page for notifications

Created the React frontend page endpoint for notifications

Which, when accessed, looks like this:

### DynamoDB Local container
Included the `dynamodb-local` container to the Docker Compose and tested it out

![](./assets/week1/dynamodb-local.png)

I really liked that we get to play around with DynamoDB local. This is something I've been meaning to do for some time but didn't have the excuse to do it ðŸš€


### PostgreSQL container
Included the `postgres` container to the Docker Compose and tested it out
